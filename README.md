# slight-generation

## Update October 2023: 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [Poe-api](https://github.com/ading2210/poe-api), which this project relied on, was stopped from being maintained since September 2023. Therefore, this project is currently not working.
- üöß We are looking for alternatives to fix this.

## Introduction
SLIGHT-GENERATION is a product aiming to help reducing the time and effort when making presentation slides. The name SLIGHT was combined from SLIDE(presentation) and LIGHT(fast and easy).

## Demo
This is a 4-step creating process on our deployed version:
- Step 1: Click `CREATE SLIDES NOW`
- Step 2: Topic: Type in the topic you want the presentaion to be about, then click `Next`
- Step 3: Additional settings: change anything if you want to, then click `Next`
- Step 4: Auto Generation: Wait for 1-2 minutes and a presentation will be automatically downloaded

#### Result
This presentation was produced with the topic "Albert Einstein" (other settings left as default).
